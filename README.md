# Soccer_Match_Outcomes_Project
Final project of Data Preparation and Analysis course. 

Built a prediction and a classification model in R to establish the outcome of a soccer match and compared both methodologies.

Applied a Poisson Regression Model to obtain the number of scores and used a Random Forest Model to get the winning team.
